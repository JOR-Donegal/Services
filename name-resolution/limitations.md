# Limitations

At time of writing there were over 1,000 gTLDs and c.250 ccTLDs.&#x20;

* Each branch is a label <63 characters&#x20;
* Each word between dots <63 characters&#x20;
* Total domain name <253 characters&#x20;
* Total Levels <= 127&#x20;
* Each label may consist of any character but in practice uses letters, digits, hyphens&#x20;
* An NS record defines a name server for the domain
